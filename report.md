## Data Viz Summary
![Racism in Jail](images/racism%20in%20Jail.png)

The bar graph of Racism in Jail shows the rates of mental illness diagnosis of incarcerated people grouped by race and ethnicity. Above 20% of white people receive mental health diagnoses, which indicates a higher proportion than different diversities of people, including Black, Hispanic, and others. This data visualization also clearly verifies the privileges of the dominant group, where white people are more likely to receive unfair advantages due to the preference of their race. The exclusive environment, microaggression, and stereotypes still happen everywhere, cutting out an invisible boundary between people from different cultural backgrounds. 

**Either way, the racial and ethnic disparities are a product of structural racism.**
## Data Viz Biography
**Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

The data came from Fatos Kaba et al., based on a research study of “Disparities in Mental Health Referral and Diagnosis in the New York City Jail Mental Health Service.” And, the graphic created by Catherine D’lgnazio. 

**When was it produced?**

The data recorded around forty-five thousand first-time incarcerated people in New York City jails between 2011 and 2013. 

**Who is the audience for the visualization?**

The targeted audience can include people of different ages, gender; and career backgrounds. More specifically, researchers convert it to relevant evidence and conclusion, which can be used in their study of race and ethnicity. On the other hand, data journalists or editors publish the following report based on the given data, trying their best to be neutral and precise. 

**How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

The visualization has interpreted the ethnicity disparities in awareness, which uses the above 20% of white people with mental health diagnoses to verify the divergence rates experienced by these groups before becoming incarcerated and the distinct treatment within the New York jail system. It allows people to pay more attention to the social issue by making their own judgment and considering the next-step improvement. However, the misinterpretation of this data might come from its possibility to be viewed as a generalization since the visualization only concludes the mental health diagnosis rates in NYC jails instead of the entire population. Therefore, it is difficult to consider this data visualization as an overlook, well-fitting, or oversimplification of the complicated issue of ethnicity. And, that might weaken and hinder the progress in solving this issue.

**How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**
