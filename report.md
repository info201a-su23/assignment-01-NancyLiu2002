## Data Viz Summary
![Racism in Jail](images/racism%20in%20Jail.png)

The bar graph of Racism in Jail shows the rates of mental illness diagnosis of incarcerated people grouped by their race and ethnicity. Above 20% of white people receive mental health diagnoses, which indicates a higher proportion than different diversities of people, including Black, Hispanic, and others. This data visualization also clearly verifies the privileges of the dominant group, where white people are more likely to receive unfair advantages due to the preference of their race. The exclusive environment, microaggression, and stereotypes still happen everywhere, cutting out an invisible boundary between people from different cultural backgrounds. 

**Either way, the racial and ethnic disparities are a product of structural racism.**
